# SimpleSourceProtector


## About

The program is designed for simple protection of source codes in C#(not assemblies). A well-compiled project is required for correct operation. In the first stage, 
all projects that are in dependence are merged. The next step is renaming the classes, methods, variables, etc. At the final stage, the all documents is merged into 
one large document and compression is performed by removing the spaces.

The project uses Roslyn libraries.
